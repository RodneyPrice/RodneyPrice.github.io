SMH here has created the 1v1 Catalog project, the goal here was to create something that was more comprehensive than a pokepaste to store all of the sets. 

RANKINGS OF POKEMON:

Technical: These pokemon sets use various methods of wearing down or weakening the opponent in order to finish them off or by boosting their own defenses by an absurd speed in order to weaken their enemey attacks to finish them off. The culprits of this classification are all stall sets and bulky pokemon.

Power: Power mons are mons that have unrelenting power that is difficult to outdo from the getgo. Wearing down these mons could be dead sentence for you as they can quickly overpower you in a matter of 5 turns at the most. 

Fast: Now this ranking might seem weird, but when explained it makes a lot of sense. Fast pokemon are mons that are known for using one high powered Z-move and sometimes an extra move to finish off their opponent. An example can be Donphan, Donphan is considered {fast} because of its strong Z-move stab with Ice shard to finish off any power pokemon that doesn't resist both Rock and Ground. Fast doesn't mean fast in stats, but fast in how they end the round fast. 

Standard: If a pokemon can't fit in two or less of these classifications listed above, they will be "Standard Pokemon" these pokemon can take any role needed by a team. Examples of standard pokemon are Mew and Mega-Gyarados.

What about Lure Sets?

Lure sets do not define what a pokemon is capable of. A Dragonite could run Inner Focus to kill unsuspecting Lopunnys. You can make a lure set out of any viable pokemon. I(We) decided that lure sets should not be considered a classification but instead an attribute. An extra thing that makes this set special.

Class Triangle:

If we lived in a world where there was no RNG hax and lure sets/Counter teaming. There would be a class triangle laid out a little bit like this:

Power > TECHNICAL > Fast
Fast > POWER > Technical
Technical > FAST > Power

Makes a lot of sense if we use examples. Mimikyu (Technical) can beat Donphan because of its (Technical Ability: Disguise) which makes Donphan unable to kill it fast enough before Mimikyu kills it. Mimikyu is also immune to sneaky Donphan moves such as Counter and Endeavor because of its typing. However Metegross-Mega (Power) can kill Mimikyu (Technical) because of its typing and access to Bullet Punch which can one shot Mimikyu from 50%.

Metegross-Mega > MIMIKYU > Donphan
Donphan > METEGROSS-MEGA > Mimikyu
Mimikyu > DONPHAN > Mega Metegross

That's how the class triangle would work in general.
