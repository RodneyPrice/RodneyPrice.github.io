# RodneyPrice.github.io

This started as a little side project of mine, building frameworks for certain pokemon in order to help others teambuild. @Mace Master and a couple others liked what I was doing so I felt compelled to continue the project. The idea morphed and morphed into something bigger. It morphed into this github website. 

Goal: Display more information about a specific set that the sets pokepaste was unable to do because of the way pokepaste was designed.
