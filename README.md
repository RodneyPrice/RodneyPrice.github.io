SMH here has created the 1v1 Catalog project, the goal here was to create something that was better than a dirty pokepaste to store all of the sets. This catalog is user friendly and easy to understand

RANKINGS OF POKEMON:

Technical: These pokemon sets use various methods of wearing down or weakening the opponent in order to finish them off. The culprits of this classification are all stall sets and bulky pokemon.

Power: Power mons are mons that have unrelenting power that is difficult to outdo from the getgo. Wearing down these mons could be dead sentence for you as they can quickly overpower you in a matter of 5 turns at the most. 

Fast: Now this ranking might seem weird, but when explained it makes a lot of sense. Fast pokemon are mons that are known for using one high powered Z-move and sometimes an extra move to finish off their opponent. An example can be Donphan, Donphan is considered {fast} because of its strong Z-move stab with Ice shard to finish off any power pokemon that doesn't resist both Rock and Ground. Fast doesn't mean fast in stats, but fast in how they end the round fast.
